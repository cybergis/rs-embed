# Changelog

All notable changes to `rs-embed` will be documented in this file.

The project keeps this changelog as the canonical release record. GitHub Releases should summarize the same versioned changes rather than introducing a second source of truth.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and the project follows Semantic Versioning with extra care around model and embedding semantics.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Standardised NumPy docstrings across all public functions and classes in `export.py`, `inspect.py`, `writers.py`, and the `tools/` and `providers/` layers. No behaviour changes.
### Added

- Versioned documentation with a version selector powered by `mike` and MkDocs Material. Each release tag deploys a pinned version; pushes to `main` update a `dev` alias. The `mike`, `mkdocs-material`, and `pymdown-extensions` packages are now included in the `[dev]` optional group.

- `load_export(path)` reader API that loads any export produced by `export_batch(...)` — both combined (single file) and per-item (directory) layouts — and returns a structured `ExportResult`. Failed points are NaN-filled rather than dropped, partial model runs are surfaced via `status="partial"`, and `ExportResult.embedding(model)` provides a typed shortcut to the embedding array.

### Changed

- `anysat` now defaults `grid` output to native `dense` features while keeping pooled output on patch-grid pooling by default, with new AnySat-specific switches for `grid_feature_mode` (`dense`/`patch`) and `pooled_source` (`patch`/`tile`).
- `galileo` now aligns more closely with the upstream NASA Harvest runtime: `grid` output prefers Galileo's own patch-level token averaging path, automatic NDVI derivation has been removed, and the default normalization mode is now `none` with an `official_stats` option for upstream pretraining statistics.
- `satvision_toa` now uses the vendored official SatVision runtime as its only model path and narrows provider-side preprocessing to the default MODIS proxy route (`MOD09GA` reflectance + `MOD21A1D` thermal proxy). Custom collections are no longer treated as implicit GEE fallbacks; callers should pass calibrated `input_chw` directly for non-default inputs.

### Fixed

- `device="auto"` now correctly selects MPS on Apple Silicon instead of silently falling back to CPU. Follows the PyTorch-recommended priority (`cuda > mps > cpu`), giving an approximately 4x speedup on Apple M-series hardware for all API calls that use the default device.
- `galileo` month overrides now use the official zero-based month indexing expected by Galileo embeddings, fixing the previous one-month offset in `RS_EMBED_GALILEO_MONTH`.
- `satvision_toa` `grid` output now consistently extracts spatial features from the official-style SwinV2 path instead of misinterpreting pooled vectors as token grids, and the tightened fetch path records explicit proxy provenance in metadata.
- `scalemae` now follows the official feature-extraction path more closely: the adapter unwraps common `rshf` wrappers to call the nested ScaleMAE backbone's `forward_features(...)` instead of falling back to wrapper `forward()`, uses ImageNet eval preprocessing (`Resize(short side) + CenterCrop + Normalize`) with effective post-preprocess `input_res_m`, and fixes the declarative input metadata to reflect raw Sentinel-2 SR inputs plus adapter-managed preprocessing.
- `satmaepp` and `satmaepp_s2_10b` now align more closely with the official SatMAE++ preprocessing paths. The RGB adapter now defaults to `rgb` channel order for the published fMoW-RGB checkpoint and no longer pre-resizes provider/input overrides before the official eval transform, while the Sentinel-2 10-band adapter no longer sanitizes inputs with adapter-side `clip` / `nan_to_num` before the source-style `SentinelNormalize -> ToTensor -> Resize(short side) -> CenterCrop` pipeline.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Automated pull request changelog enforcement with a `skip-changelog` escape hatch for docs, tests, CI, and other internal-only changes.
- Tag-driven GitHub Release publishing that uses the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as the release notes.
- Trusted Publishing release automation for PyPI and TestPyPI, including a manual TestPyPI dry run and install smoke test.

### Changed

- The contribution and release workflow now treats `CHANGELOG.md` as the canonical source for user-visible release notes.
- The tag-triggered release flow now validates `src/rs_embed/_version.py`, publishes to PyPI, and only then creates the GitHub Release.
- The tag-triggered release flow now validates the matching `CHANGELOG.md` entry before publishing to PyPI, so a missing release-notes section fails early instead of after package upload.
- The base package installation now includes the Copernicus GeoTIFF runtime (`tifffile` and `imagecodecs`) instead of requiring a separate extra.
- The public docs now default to `pip install rs-embed` for published releases while keeping editable installs documented for repository development.

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

- The TestPyPI smoke test now verifies package importability and the `rs-embed` CLI entry point, not just installability and version metadata.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

- Initial public alpha release of `rs-embed`.
- Unified ROI to embedding API centered on `get_embedding(...)`, `get_embeddings_batch(...)`, `export_batch(...)`, and `inspect_provider_patch(...)`.
- Support for precomputed embedding products including `tessera`, `gse`, and `copernicus`.
- Support for on-the-fly model adapters including `satmae`, `satmaepp`, `satmaepp_s2_10b`, `prithvi`, `scalemae`, `remoteclip`, `dofa`, `satvision`, `anysat`, `galileo`, `wildsat`, `fomo`, `terramind`, `terrafm`, `thor`, and `agrifm`.
- Documentation site covering quickstart, model behavior, API contracts, and extension guidance.
